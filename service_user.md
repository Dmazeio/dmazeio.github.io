## What is a Service User?
A service user is like a special "robot account" that software programs use to talk to each other.

Imagine you have two apps: one for ordering pizza and another for delivering it. When these two apps need to communicate—say, to tell the delivery app that a pizza is ready to be delivered—they don't use a regular human account (like yours or mine). Instead, they use a special kind of account that is only for apps or machines to talk to each other. That's what a service user is.

### Why Use a Service User?
- **Security**: It's safer. Instead of using a real person's account, which might have access to other things, we use a service user with just the right permissions for what it needs to do.
- **Automation**: It helps automate tasks. Because these accounts are set up specifically for machines, they can run jobs, send messages, and do other tasks without needing a person to log in.
- **Tracking**: You can easily see what actions the apps or machines are taking, as all their activities are tied to the service user. It’s like having a unique ID for each machine so you know who did what.

### How is a Service User Different from a Regular User?

- **No Human Involvement**: A service user doesn’t belong to a person. It belongs to an app or service.
- **Special Permissions**: Service users usually have only the permissions they need to get the job done, nothing more. This is to minimize risk.
- **No Personal Data**: Since it’s not a person, there’s no personal data attached to it (like email or profile information).

### In Short
A service user is an account created specifically for software programs to communicate and work together securely, automatically, and efficiently without human involvement.
