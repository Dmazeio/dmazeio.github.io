## Welcome to UXRisk Dev Docs

UXRisk provides an extensive API to allow third party developers full access to all operations and data in UXRisk. For now, only 'Enterprise' customers can access the API, using Azure AD client id and secrets to obtain a JSON Web Token (jwt). 

To interact with our API you need to create an app registration in your Azure Active Directory. [Follow our documentation](app_reg.md) to complete the app registration.

Once the app is registered properly you can [aquire an access token](aquire_token.md) to call our API.

With the access token you can make [basic api calls](basic.md) and get to understand how our API works. 

We have some [Frequently Asked Questions](faq.md), but that's all for now.
